## For Your Safety
Do not open files containing macros unless they are from a trusted source. Macros from questionable sources can contain harmful code that will hack into your computer. The code from this project is free of any harmful code, which can easily be verfied by looking through the code itself. However, it is still advised to only enable macros for your current session instead of enabling them permanently. Doing so is best practice for avoiding harmful macros from being run on your computer.
